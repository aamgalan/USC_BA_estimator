# 3D-CNN BA estimator
We provide Python code to estimate brain age (BA) from a raw T1-weighted MRI scan (brain.mgz file). Our architecture takes as input a T1-weighted MRI scan and processes it as described in the original publication. Sample code to calculate BA in a sample subject is provided in "/3D-CNN/ONNX_demo.ipynb". Our onnx files, which contain the compressed model architecture, are in the Models folder. We suggest using Google Colab or Jupyter notebook to execute our code. Direct all questions and comments to irimia.laboratory@gmail.com.  Please acknowledge the original publication when using this code:
